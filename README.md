Project Goal: The project aims to predict median house values in California districts using machine learning.

Dataset: The project uses the California Housing dataset, which includes features like median income, housing age, average rooms, and population.

Methodology:

Data Preparation: The dataset is loaded, explored using descriptive statistics and correlation analysis, and features are scaled using StandardScaler.
Model Training: Two regression models are trained: Linear Regression and Random Forest Regression.
Model Evaluation: Models are evaluated using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (R2) metrics, along with cross-validation.
Visualization: Scatter plots are used to compare actual versus predicted house values for both models.
Results:

Both models achieve reasonable accuracy in predicting house values.
Random Forest Regression generally performs better than Linear Regression, likely due to its ability to handle non-linear relationships in the data.The accuracy of random forest is 80% and 57% is for Linear regression.
Key Findings:

The project demonstrates the application of machine learning for predicting house prices.
Feature scaling and model selection are crucial steps for achieving good performance.
Random Forest Regression is a powerful model for handling complex datasets.
